This workflow was created in Python with the help of [Dean Jackson's](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) Alfred library and the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library.  It is based heavily on the [Frank Spinillo's slackfred](https://github.com/fspinillo/slackfred).
